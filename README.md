# Py-Abaqus
Repo of all data and algorithms meant for Graduation Thesis of Geoengineering Master of Xubin Jiang who graduated from the College of Civil Engineering and Architecture of  Zhejiang University. You are welcomed to utilize and spread this project for free. Project url is https://github.com/jiangxubin/py-abaqus. 
# Fold instruction
* data:Directory where raw model output data is strored
* output: Directory where results which have been post-processed 
* src: Post-process functions, Python code of building Abaqus models which are embedded in extended finite element feature(so-called xfem model),Python script of extract data from Abaqus output data. 
# Algorithm explanation of code in src
## XFEM model buiding algorithm
## XFEM database extraction algorithm
## XFEM crack length algorithm
